# Changelog

All notable changes to ZenBrain are documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-08

### Documentation fix

- Root `README.md` "Want the advanced algorithms?" example fixed: the previous snippet called `computeKGPredictionError({ predicted, observed })` and `computeAdaptiveFSRSInterval({ baseInterval, predictionError })`, both of which are wrong — the actual signatures take embedding arrays and positional arguments. Anyone copy-pasting the old snippet hit a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`. The example now uses the real API.

No code changes; doc fix only.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-08

### Documentation cleanup

Cosmetic patch — no code changes. Removes references to a specific submission venue from public-facing surfaces (description, README, source-file headers, GitHub release notes). Algorithms themselves and their references to the underlying neuroscience literature are unchanged.

- `package.json` `description` reworded — drops the venue-specific "extensions" framing.
- `packages/algorithms/README.md` "What's Inside" advanced-algorithm table reworded; the second column now lists the inspiring research direction instead of a venue label.
- Root `README.md` and `docs/FAQ.md` stats baseline retained from 0.3.1.
- Source-file JSDoc headers reworded.

(0.3.1 was tagged on GitHub but never published to npm; 0.3.2 supersedes it.)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-08

### Advanced algorithms

Adds 10 advanced algorithms grounded in recent neuroscience and ML research to the open-source `@zensation/algorithms` package.

**`@zensation/algorithms@0.3.0`** — 10 new algorithms (zero dependencies, pure TypeScript):

| Algorithm | Sub-path |
|---|---|
| Prediction-Error Coupled FSRS | `./fsrs-vmPFC` |
| Two-Factor Synaptic Hebbian | `./hebbian-two-factor` |
| Simulation-Selection Sleep Loop | `./sleep-simulation-selection` |
| Spectral KG Health Monitor | `./spectral-health` |
| Information-Bottleneck Budget | `./ib-budget` |
| Dopamine-Modulated Routing | `./dopamine-routing` |
| Hopfield Short-Term Memory | `./hopfield-stm` |
| Personalized PageRank | `./personalized-pagerank` |
| Surprise-Gradient (Variational FE) Memory | `./surprise-gradient-memory` |
| Temporal Multi-Route Retrieval | `./temporal-multi-route` |

### Tests
- **+250 new tests** (429 total, 179 existing + 250 new). All passing on vitest.

### Build
- `tsup` ESM + CJS + DTS dual format extended to all 22 algorithm modules.
- Package size: 379 KB packed, 1.7 MB unpacked, 152 files.

### Breaking changes
- None. Additive release; existing 0.2.x APIs unchanged.

### Notes
- The `AblationRegistry` interface in `./sleep-simulation-selection` is an *optional* injection point for ablation studies — pass `undefined` for default PMA-aware behavior.
- All algorithms remain zero runtime dependencies.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **Dual ESM/CJS build:** `import` and `require()` both work correctly. v0.2.0 had missing `.js` extensions in ESM that caused runtime failures.
- Migrated from raw `tsc` to **tsup** for reliable dual-format output.
- All `exports` maps now include `require` condition for CJS consumers.

### Changed
- 276 tests, all passing (179 algorithms + 97 core).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- **MemoryCoordinator** — Orchestrates all 7 memory layers (Working, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Core, Cross-Context, Sleep). Auto-routing `store()`, cross-layer `recall()`, `consolidate()`, `decay()`, FSRS review queue.
- **Sleep Consolidation** (`@zensation/algorithms`) — Memory replay simulation: `selectForReplay()`, `simulateReplay()`, `pruneWeakConnections()`. Based on Stickgold & Walker (2013).
- **Confidence Intervals** — 95% CI for FSRS retrievability and Bayesian propagation.
- **Retention Visualization** — Export Ebbinghaus curves and FSRS schedule timelines.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- Initial public release.
- 12 neuroscience-inspired memory algorithms (FSRS, Ebbinghaus, Hebbian, Bayesian, Emotional, Context-Retrieval, Similarity, Intervals, Visualization, Sleep-Consolidation, plus shared types).
- 7-layer memory system (Working, Short-Term, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Core, Cross-Context).
- Pluggable storage / embeddings / LLM providers.
- Apache-2.0 license.
